"Having a standardised callsigns list that is accessible for all allows for much smoother comms and recognisable callsigns allow for easier acquisition of friendly elements currently in operation. All squads or individuals are free to use their own callsigns or use given server callsigns (e.g. Hitman 1-4-1) for infantry units as well as wheeled vehicles (excluding Strykers and LAVs).",
